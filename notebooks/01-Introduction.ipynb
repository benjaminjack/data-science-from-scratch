For each chapter, I'll first present a summary of the main concepts with some code examples, followed by 5-10 exercises for the reader to complete."

    "Notebooks are divided into invidual cells. A cell can contain either Python code or Markdown (a simple text-formatting language), and each cell can be selected in either _command mode_ (surrounded by a blue box) or _edit mode_ (surrounded by a green box). In edit mode, as the name implies, you can edit the contents of a cell. To enter edit mode, click on a selected cell, or select the cell and press `enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All cells can be executed. If the cell is a Python cell, the Python code executes and any output is presented below the cell. If the cell is Markdown, executing the cell renders the Markdown into formatted text. You can change the type of cell by using the dropdown menu in the toolbar at the top of the page. To execute a cell, click Run in the tool bar, or press `shift-enter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At any time, you can return to command mode by pressing `esc`. Once on command mode, press `h` for help. This help page will show a complete list of shortcuts in Jupyter notebooks. I suggest memorizing at least a few of these shortcuts.\n",

    "To add a cell below the current cell, press the plus (+) button in the tool bar, or press `b` (for *b*elow) in command mode.\n",
